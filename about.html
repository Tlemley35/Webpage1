		<p>Tattoo pricing is fairly consistent wherever you go, all of mine were $100 per hour. The tattoo experience varies with each individual. Those with higher amounts of fat will feel less pain, and the opposite goes for those with low body fat.<br>
		They usually take about a week to begin peeling. After the tattoo, Vaseline or some lubricant is applied under a plastic wrap. After 20 minutes the wrap can be removed and the healing process will begin. Over the next month or so, the tattoo will itch, peel, burn, etc. The key to a tattoo coming out perfectly is consistent lubrication with an unscented lotion. I found that using Vaseline tends to cover your poured and cause break outs on the art work. After completely healed, your tattoo is with you forever.</p>
