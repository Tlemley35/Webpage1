				<h1>My Experience in Lamoni</h1>
				<p>Living in Lamoni has been a different experience since i am from Arizona, but I've come to have an appreciation for the small-town lifestyle.
				Lamoni is a very small town and doesn't provide you with much to do or many food options. This place has a way of bringing people together.
				While living here I have grown as an individual and progressed in my life's journey. I'm proud to say I will be graduating April 29th and have already accepted a position at a nearby organization.</p>
