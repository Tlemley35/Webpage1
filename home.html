		<h1>Why Tattoos?</h1>

		<p id="pHome"> I love tattoos because they are a lifetime worth of memories which I get to take with me wherever I go. Throughout life, we go through constant changes. Even if say hunting someday is not part of my life, I will always want to remember the lessons, and experiences. Tattoos are an amazing way to capture pieces of life.<br>
		I have 25 hours total in my sleeve and 4 hours in my leg. My sleeve was done at the number one shop in Arizona, and my leg was done in Leon, Iowa.</p>
